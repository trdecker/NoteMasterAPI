# NoteMasterAPI
Node endpoint running on Azure App Services. Will connect to Azure Cosmos.

I wanted my note taking application, Note Master, to be able to save, edit, and delete notes saved to a backend. This is the API to fulfill that purpose!
Check out the frontend [here](https://github.com/trdecker/NoteMaster).
